<p class="about">As a Vice President of the club, I assists and coordinates the President in managing meetings and hosting various activities. Being a responsible economics student not only makes me proficient in the subject but also the ideal person to complement the President in ensuring effective functioning of the club takes place. Furthermore, I look forward to pursuing a job entitled to this field. One of the most noticeable things about me is his dedication towards his commitments as well as the ability to think outside the box. During his free time, he is usually found reading the latest novels or watching shows.</p>
